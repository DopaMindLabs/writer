## Coding standards (read first)

This repo enforces a strict standard adapted from NASA/JPL's "Power of Ten". See
[CODING_STANDARDS.md](./CODING_STANDARDS.md). When writing or editing code:

- New or edited code must pass `npx eslint <files> --max-warnings=0` (the pre-commit hook
  enforces this on staged files). Existing warnings are a tracked backlog; do not add to it.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` before committing; both gate CI.
- Use `invariant()` and `assertNever()` from `@/lib/invariant` to validate untrusted input.
- Write all functions as arrow functions (`const f = () => …`), including utilities.
- A test file's extension mirrors the file under test: `foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts`,
  `foo.tsx` → `foo.test.tsx`.
- `src/tours/` is exempt; `src/editor/` relaxes size limits only. For a one-off exception,
  add `// nasa-exception: <rule> (<reason>)` above an `// eslint-disable-next-line`.

## Key commands

- `npm run dev`: Vite dev server
- `npm run lint` and `npm run lint:fix`: ESLint
- `npm run typecheck`: `tsc --noEmit`
- `npm run test:run`: unit tests (Vitest, once)
- `npm run test:e2e`: Playwright e2e
